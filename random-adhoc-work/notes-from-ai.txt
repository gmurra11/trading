There are a few ways to make this code run faster. Here are a few suggestions:

Use the aiohttp library for asynchronous HTTP requests. This can help reduce the time it takes to make HTTP requests, as the code will not have to wait for the request to complete before moving on to the next task.
To use aiohttp, you will need to modify the get_inflation_data function to use async/await syntax, and use the aiohttp.ClientSession object to make the HTTP requests. Here's an example of how to do this:

Copy code
import aiohttp

async def get_inflation_data(url, find):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            contents = await response.text()
            soup = BeautifulSoup(contents, 'html.parser')
            inflation_data = soup.find('td', headers=find)
            return inflation_data.find('span', class_='datavalue')
Use the threading module to run the place_market_order_buy and place_market_order_sell functions in separate threads. This can help reduce the time it takes to execute these functions, as they will be able to run concurrently.
To use threading, you will need to modify the place_market_order_buy and place_market_order_sell functions to use the Thread class from the threading module. Here's an example of how to do this:

Copy code
import threading

def place_market_order_buy():
    # function code goes here

def place_market_order_sell():
    # function code goes here

thread1 = threading.Thread(target=place_market_order_buy)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=place_market_order_sell)

thread1.start()
thread2.start()

thread1.join()
thread2.join()
Cache the results of the HTTP requests to avoid making unnecessary requests. For example, you could store the results of the requests in a dictionary or file, and check if the data for a particular date has already been retrieved before making a new request. This can help reduce the overall time it takes to execute the code, as it will not need to make as many HTTP requests.
I hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
